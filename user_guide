you will need to install these to run the script:
1, Python (v3.9 works, not sure if Python2 works)
2, Python modules: tkinter, os, subprocess, re
3, /Applications/nmrfam-sparky-mac/NMRFAM-SPARKY.app/Contents/Resources/bin/bruk2ucsf   (need to adapt the script if this path is different)
4, /Applications/nmrfam-sparky-mac/NMRFAM-SPARKY.app/Contents/Resources/bin/ucsfdata    (need to adapt the script if this path is different)


to run the script:
python spc.py

how to use the GUI:
1, click select to select the bruker folder (containing 1/ 2/ 3/ ...)
2, click update to extract experiment and sample information
	2.1, sample/ buffer/ ligand info are extracted from 1/pdata/1/title
	2.2, temperature/magnetic field are extracted from 1/acqus
	2.3, you can also manually type in the values
	2.4, ligand line format example: 'ligand: 5 % HMGN'
	2.5, manually choose labeling scheme and reference molecule in the dropdown menu
	2.6, experiments with 2rr will be listed in spectra list and sort by titration steps
	2.7, by default select all the spectra in the spectra list
	2.8, can manually unselect one or more spectra by mouse click while holding ctrl key 
	2.9, Sparky folder by default is put under bruker folder
	2.10, Sparky folder can be changed to other path by select button
	2.11, Sparky folder can be created under a selected folder by create button
   	2.12, Sparky project name by default is ligand-titration.proj
   	2.13, Sparky project name can be manually changed to other names
3, click convert to sparky, to generate a Sparky folder and .proj with selected spectra
	3.1, generate Sparky folder under bruker path
	3.2, generate sub folder Projects/ Data/ Save/ Lists/ if not already exist
	3.3, bruk2ucsf each selected spectra to ucsf in Data/
	3.4, write .save for each .ucsf, automatic set contour based on clevels, assign different color to each spectra
	3.5, write .proj with all selected spectra
	3.6, metadata.txt is generated in the Sparky folder recording all metadata in the GUI

for future development:
1, 3rrr for now is # out, because lack of ligand line in title file will give error
